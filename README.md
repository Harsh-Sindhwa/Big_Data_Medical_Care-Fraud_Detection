# Big_Data_Medical_Care-Fraud_Detection

# INTRODUCTION


Healthcare is a significant industry in the U.S. with both private and government run programs. The expenses of medicinal services keep on ascending, to some degree because of the expanding populace of the old. U.S. health insurance spending from 2012 to 2014 has expanded by 6.7% to reach $3 trillion and Medicare spending represents 20% of all human services spending in the U.S. at about $600 billion. 
This rising older populace, joined with the expanded expenses of Medicare, need cost-cutting arrangements, where the decrease in misrepresentation is one approach to help recuperate costs and diminish by and large installments. The effect of health care extortion is evaluated to be between 3% to 10% of the country's absolute human services spending and proceeding to antagonistically affect the Medicare program and its recipients (NHCAA 2017). 
Government has introduced the projects, for example, the Medicare Fraud Strike Force (OIG 2017), authorized to help battle misrepresentation, however proceeded with endeavours are expected to more likely alleviate the impacts of extortion. These are our task's essential presentation and foundation; likewise, it shows that there are immense business open doors for Medicare Fraud Detection frameworks.
This project is committed to building big data solutions with substantial applications at the crossing point of the health care and protection industry. This Capstone undertaking will construct a Medicare Fraud Detection model to investigate open information and foresee/identify the false Medicare supplier’s dependent on misrepresentation designs, oddity examination, and geo-segment measurements.
Our aim is to create a model that predicts the fraud in the health insurance industry using anomaly analysis and geo-demographic metrics. There will be several advantages if we are able to find out the fraud detection accurately. Here are the following advantages:

•	Protection and Cost deduction
Recognizing extortion in advance methods no all the more pursuing the lawbreakers after installments have been made, alongside the insightful and lawful expenses. It's only an a lot more intelligent approach to work together. Furthermore, regardless of whether that cost reserve funds sway your own business primary concern or that of an open element with whom you are gotten, the outcomes must be acceptable ones.

•	Fraud Prevention becomes easy
As our model learns we can help in providing additional information for accessing any fraud. It would provide a helping hand in finding possible patterns by comparing one another.

•	Payers Can Maintain Compliance with Government Prompt Payment Regs
The measure of manual "pursuing" down of cases, regardless of whether pre-or post-installment, is essentially diminished. Examination can occur progressively, as cases are introduced, and goals accomplished a lot quicker. Regardless of whether you are a steward of open dollars or your very own steward business' monetary wellbeing, a prescient examination programming framework just bodes well.




# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Building an innovative data science model that help in predicting fraud in medical insurance industry by using real time analysis and classification algorithm. This tool can be used by the government so that it benefits the patients, pharmacy, doctors which eventually help in gaining credibility to industry, tackle the increasing costs of healthcare and handle the impact of fraud.
Medicinal services misrepresentation is a principle issue that causes generous fiscal misfortune in Medicare/Medicaid and protection industry. The Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have arrangement Medicare Part D programs since 2006. CMS depends on it to identify and forestall extortion, waste and maltreatment in Part D program. Be that as it may, utilizing the customary techniques, the misrepresentation location is directed on arbitrary examples by human specialists. The results are the examples may be deluding or manual identification is exorbitant. As per Office of Inspector General report: Since 2006, the Medicare Fraud has quickly expanded. The extortion designs incorporate the accompanying four sorts:
• Fraud by Service Providers (Doctors, hospitals, pharmacies) 
• Fraud by Insurance subscribers (patient or patient’s employers)
• Fraud by insurance carriers 
• Conspiracy Frauds (involved with all parties)

The main objectives of this project are:
• Build a basic Data Model to show the connections among the distinctive datasets and distinguish the key capabilities for extortion recognitions
• Build a thorough AI model to recognize misrepresentation design dependent on the various highlights: Service Providers (Doctors, Pharmacies), Insurance supporters (patients), Geo-segment and usually misuse drugs medicines
• Setup a benchmark measurement to quantify and assess the test result
• Market-prepared item
